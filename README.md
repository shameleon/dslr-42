# Dslr  : Datascience X Logistic Regression

---

Machine Learning project at 42 school.

Dslr consists of training a ***multivariate logistic regression model** to solve a classification problem.

---

The main objective is to recreate a magic Sorting Hat to predict Hogwarts student houses. When Harry Potter universe meet a Data sciencist.

1600 students caracteristics each with his own set of skills in `Arithmancy,Astronomy,Herbology,Defense Against the Dark Arts,Divination,Muggle Studies,Ancient Runes,History of Magic,Transfiguration,Potions,Care of Magical Creatures,Charms,Flying`.

A model is trained, based on selected features, it can accurately predict student affiliation to one of the four hogwart's houses (`Gryffindor` `Hufflepuff` `Ravenclaw` or `Slytherin`)

---

## Usage

`make` to install the *virtual environement* with its *requirements*.

activate `venv`:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, ```python ./dslr/logreg_train.py``` to train the dataset.

```python ./dslr/logreg_predict.py``` to predict.

### Describe

`describe.py` mimics *pandas* library `describe()` function.
A data file must be provided as argument.

Describing the training dataset :

```shell
python ./dslr/describe.py datasets/dataset_train.csv
```

Output:

```table
         Index Arithmancy Astronomy  ... Care of Magical Creatures   Charms   Flying
count  1600.00    1566.00   1568.00  ...                   1560.00  1600.00  1600.00

```

#### Tests

Test runner chosen : `unittest` included in Python standard library.

`./dslr/tests/testDescribe.py` compares `DescriberClass` and pandas.describe()

`./dslr/tests/testUtilsMath.py` compares `utils.math.py` functions and numpy / pandas equivalent functions

#### describe.exe

An executable application could be built with
[pyinstaller](https://realpython.com/pyinstaller-python/)

- adding the entry-point script

```shell
pyinstaller ./dslr/describe.py
```

## Project status

The project has to be accomplished by a team of two studs in order to be validated.
Since there is some bug on 42-intra, unfairly blocking me for that project,
I am doing it all by myself while awaiting for 42-staff to unblock me.

### To-do-list

||from Done| status | to do next|
|---|:---:|---|---|
|describe.py | `80%` | functional |+ unit testing(50%), + add bonus|
|plots| `50%` | undone | analysis ok in jupyter notebook >> to .py|
|logreg train |`80%`|  functional | remove comments|
|logreg predict | `90%` |  functional | remove comments|
|model metrics| `20%` | X |choose relevent metrics, start toolkit|
|bonus|`0%`||||

### Results so far

`98.3%` prediction accuracy on the training dataset with a 10-feature based model.
I have to try to increase accuracy with other feature(s).

## Subject

### Mandatory part

#### Describe from scratch

A ```describe.py``` program to describe the dataset, that behaves as ```nympy.describe()```. It is forbidden to use any function that makes the job,
like: count, mean, std, min, max, percentile, etc...

#### Logistic regression training

```multi-classifier using a logistic regression one-vs-all```
logreg_train.[extension] dataset_train.csv

Gradient descent algoritm to minimize the error

Generates a file containing the model weights.

Usage :

```shell
logreg_predict.[extension] dataset_train.csv [weights]
```

#### Prediction

Predict from '.datasets/dataset_test.csv' and generate a prediction file `houses.csv`` formatted exactly as follows:

```shell
$> cat houses.csv
Index,Hogwarts House
0,Gryffindor
1,Hufflepuff
2,Ravenclaw
[...] 
```

### Bonus

• Add more fields for describe.py
• Implement a stochastic gradient descent
• Implement other optimization algorithms (Batch GD/mini-batch GD/ you name

### Peer-Evaluation

Answers will be evaluated using accuracy score of the Scikit-Learn library. Professor
McGonagall agrees that your algorithm is comparable to the Sorting Hat only if it has a
minimum precision of 98% .

## My solution to Dslr

### venv

Virtual environment is created by a `Makefile`.
In a terminal, ```make``` command, then

```shell
source /venv/bin/activate
```
