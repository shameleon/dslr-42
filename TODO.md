### Issues

- [ ] issue #cheating : describe is used for testing
            purpose in DescriberClass main and testDescribe.py
- [ ] issue : Scale pairplot matrix to screen
- [ ] issue : Display live cost during training - might slow down
- [ ] issue : Display dataset details during training

### Todo

- [ ] Bonus for describe.py
- [ ] add plot logreg-predict.py
- [ ] choose relevent model metrics
- [ ] Bonus : Stochastic Gradient Descent

### In Progress

### Results so far

`98.3%` prediction accuracy on the training dataset with a 10-feature based model.
I have to try to increase accuracy with other feature(s).
