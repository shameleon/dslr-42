### Issues

- [ ] issue : Display live cost during training - might slow down
- [ ] issue #cheating : describe is used for testing in DescriberClass main and testDescribe.py
- [ ] issue : Scale pairplot matrix to screen - Dell clusters
- [ ] issue : Display more dataset details during training
- [ ] issue : os.system is used, pass eveything to [os.subprocess](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess) [replace with subprocess](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess-replacements)

### Todo

- [ ] describe.py output saved to file *BonusFeature*
- [ ] summary for the training as in [odds-ratio-logistic-regressionodds-ratio-logistic-regression](https://mmuratarat.github.io/2019-09-05/odds-ratio-logistic-regression)
- [ ] add plot logreg-predict.py
- [ ] *Bonus* : Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- [ ] *Bonus* : Minibatch (SGD)
